# Design Principle roadmap
Certainly! Here's a step-by-step roadmap to help you learn the basic principles of system design within one month. Each main point is divided into subpoints to provide a clear and concise summary.

### Week 1: Foundations of System Design

#### 1. Understanding System Design
- **Definition and Importance**: Learn what system design is and why it's crucial for building scalable and efficient systems.
- **Common Terminology**: Get familiar with terms like scalability, latency, throughput, availability, and reliability.
  
#### 2. Architectural Patterns 
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Understand the single-tiered software application structure.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Learn how to decompose applications into loosely coupled services.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Study how services communicate over a network.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Explore the pattern where events trigger actions across services.

#### 3. Client-Server Model
- **Basics of Client-Server Architecture**: Understand how clients and servers interact.
- **APIs and Endpoints**: Learn about API design and how endpoints work.

### Week 2: Designing Scalable Systems
#### 4. Load Balancing
- **Concepts of Load Balancing**: Understand the purpose of distributing traffic.
- **Types of Load Balancers**: Study hardware vs. software load balancers, and learn about Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.

#### 5. Caching
- **Purpose of Caching**: Learn how caching improves performance.
- **Types of Caches**: Study in-memory caches like Redis and Memcached.
- **Cache Invalidation Strategies**: Understand different methods like write-through, write-back, and write-around.

#### 6. Database Design
- **SQL vs NoSQL Databases**: Learn the differences and when to use each.
- **Database Sharding**: Understand how to partition databases to handle large datasets.
- **Replication**: Study how to duplicate data across multiple servers for redundancy and improved performance.

### Week 3: Ensuring Reliability and Performance
#### 7. Consistency and Availability
- **CAP Theorem**: Understand the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **ACID and BASE Models**: Learn about transactional consistency vs. eventual consistency.

#### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- **Importance of Monitoring**: Learn why it's crucial to keep track of system performance.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Get familiar with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
- **Setting Up Alerts**: Learn how to configure alerts for different performance metrics.

#### 9. Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery
- **Fault Tolerance Techniques**: Understand techniques like redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Learn how to create a plan for recovering from catastrophic failures.

### Week 4: Advanced Topics and Practical Application
#### 10. Security and Authentication
- **Security Best Practices**: Study principles like least privilege and encryption.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Learn about OAuth, JWT, and other authentication mechanisms.

#### 11. Designing for Scale
- **Scalability Principles**: Understand horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
- **Distributed Systems**: Learn about the challenges and solutions in distributed computing.

#### 12. Case Studies and Design Practice
- **Analyzing Real-World Systems**: Study the design of systems like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.
- **Designing from Scratch**: Practice designing systems based on given requirements.
- **Mock Interviews**: Simulate system design interviews to test your understanding and get feedback.
